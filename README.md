# Rayoptix

`Rayoptix` is a Python library designed to run from the terminal. It facilitates the creation and evaluation of simulations for complex bifacial photovoltaic systems using ray tracing techniques. With this tool, users can define modules, set up experimental conditions, and run simulations to analyze the energy performance of these systems.

## Installation

To install `Rayoptix`, simply run:

```bash
pip install rayoptix
```

Note: It is necessary to have the Radiance and bifacial_radiance libraries installed beforehand.
